There's a restaurant pretty close to where I currently live, and I thought it would be a fun idea to re-create their website. They're currently closed down due to COVID-19, so showing this to them is currently not an option... Just doing this as a fun way to learn more about React, and some other technologies (SCSS, Redux, Gatsby JSON parsing, Google Maps API)
